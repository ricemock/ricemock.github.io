							Melissa Alter</p>
							<p>Melissa Alter is a sophomore at Rice University majoring in Psychology and Political Science, with a minor in Sociology. She was first introduced to Mock Trial in her freshman year of college and is thrilled to have met so many wonderful, inspiring people in the club. When she is not memorizing an affidavit, Melissa enjoys reading, writing, and playing with her adorable dog. She is excited to continue to learn and grow alongside Rice's blossoming program and looks forward to another amazing year.</p>

							Alizay Azeem</p>
							<p><br /> Alizay Azeem is a Wiess College sophomore, an INFJ (the advocate! let's GOOO attorneys!), and thinks Twitter is a personality trait. After Rice, she's interested in pursuing a career focused on the intersection between human rights, law, and policy. Last year was her first year doing anything like mock trial, but she'll vouch for the activity any day! From embarassingly forgetting her opening statement during her first scrimmage in fall 2019 to advancing to ORCs with her team in the spring and winning an All-Regional attorney award (that freshman year character arc :0), Alizay really enjoyed mock trial and can't wait to see the Rice University Mock Trial program grow the next three years. Outside of RUMT, she's a Rice ACLU officer, part of the Rice Journal for Public Policy team, and occasionally writes for The Rice Thresher. This fall semester she is remote, but she yearns to be back on campus (fondy and chaus specifically) as soon as possible.     <br/> </p>
							<p>Major: Social Policy Analysis, Political Science, Managerial Studies (yeah let's see how long this lasts)<br />

							Katie Bablak</p>
							<p>Divya is a sophomore at Will Rice College double majoring in political science and kinesiology. After Rice, she plans to attend either law or medical school (hence the strange double major combination). She's a huge sports fan (go stros!), so she'd love to somehow incorporate sports into her future profession. When she isn't prepping for Mock Trial, Divya is trying to channel her inner Leslie Knope by organizing campus-wide events on the Rice Program Council executive board. You can find Divya repping her residential college on the powderpuff field, clumsily walking backwards on admissions tours, or serving as a Rice Health Advisor.</p>
