						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/aryan.png" alt="" /></span>
						One of the og members of RUMT, Aryan Sefidi has been with RUMT since its founding in 2017. 
            He mainly attorneyed, earning an attorney award during the 2019 RiceBowl tournament. 
            During his last season (2019-2020), Aryan— unofficial dad of Team Gyro— mentored a team of mostly new members and led the team to (bid-earning) victory during Houston Regional and ORCs in Santa Monica where they competed against top-tier West Coast mock trial programs.
            A Philosophy and Electrical Engineering double major, Aryan currently works for Microsoft. This website is also his brainchild.

						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/members/BLAINE.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Strutting into the courtroom from the witness side of the mock trial spectrum is Blaine Schmidt: former Computational and Applied Mathematics major, and present student at Berkeley Law. 
              In the 2018-2019 competition season, Blaine earned a witness award at the Dallas regionals as British self-help guru AJ McClellan, and another at the Memphis ORCS as talent agent and part-time model Jamie Clark.
              The next year, he again witnessed on both sides: on the prosecution as the elegantly ruthless Corbin Dallas, and on the defense as happy-go-lucky hillbilly Armani Rodriguez. 
              While the 2019-2020 AMTA season was unfortunately cut short, Blaine finished his undergraduate mock trial experience captaining (and winning regionals with) the Rice B team, to whom he owes many of his best senior year memories.
