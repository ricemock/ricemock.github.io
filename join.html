									<h2><a href="#">Join Us!</a></h2>
									<p>Rice University Mock Trial is an open club, meaning that any student who is interested in Mock Trial is welcome to join!</p>
									<p>	RUMT would love to have any Rice undergraduate student who is interested in Mock Trial.
										Even if you think you have no prior experience, we would love for you to come to a meeting
										 and learn more about the team. Many people think that Mock Trial is only for people who want to become lawyers in the future, but this 
										 really isnâ€™t the case. If you have an interest in or experience with theatre or debate, Mock 
										 Trial may be a good fit for you.</p>
									<p>The team will begin meeting in the fall of each school year. Information about interest meetings
										 will be posted on our Twitter (@MockRice, link in the "About" section). For additional 
										 information, feel free to contact us through Twitter. RUMT will be competing in invitationals and 
										 scrimmages in the fall, so it is a great time for new members to try out their skills in a more casual
										  environment. If you wish to be a part of the team that will participate in AMTA tournaments in the spring 
										  (Regionals, ORCs, and Nationals), then you should come to the fall meetings to learn about the case and
										   figure out which role is the best fit for you.</p>
